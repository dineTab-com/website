                    <li>Much more so please give it a read!</li>
                </ul>

                <p>For any questions, concerns, or comments about this Privacy Policy, or to exercise any of your rights, please contact Thierry Rassam, Our Chief Privacy Officer, at <a href="mailto:legal@dinetab.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">legal@dinetab.com</a>.&nbsp;</p>

                <h3>1. <strong>Introduction</strong></h3>

                <p>DineTab Solutions Inc. (the <strong>dineTab</strong>, <strong>Company</strong>, <strong>We</strong>, <strong>Our</strong>, <strong>Us</strong>) provides its users (the<strong> Users</strong>) the ability to pay their invoice through the App for products and services they purchase at businesses that partner with Us (the <strong>SMBs</strong>). For a complete, accurate description of what We do, please see Our Terms of Use [hyperlink].&nbsp;</p>

                <p>We really respect the privacy rights of Our Users, including the person accessing and using this app or website (<strong>You</strong>). We really strive to provide You with all the details You need about how We collect, use, or disclose Your personal information so that You can provide Us with meaningful consent to use Your personal information. For Your convenience, personal information is information about an identifiable individual (as defined by applicable privacy or data protection laws). Put simply, it is information that can, alone or with other information, identify You as an individual.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>This privacy policy (the <strong>Policy</strong>) describes the kinds of personal information We collect about You, why We collect it, how We use it, how We protect it, and under what circumstances We share it with third parties. The Policy also describes the decisions You can make about Your personal information, such as how You may require Us to change, amend, or delete the personal information that You have provided to Us at any time.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>The Policy applies to Your use of all of the products and services, including dineTab’s website at dineTab.com (the <strong>Website</strong>) and dineTab’s application (the <strong>App</strong>), that are owned, operated and maintained, directly or indirectly, by dineTab, and all other products and services owned and operated by dineTab that redirect to the Website or the App, all subdomains provided through such other products or services, and all downloadable products and services, including any applications, features, functionality, content or information that is made available or provided on the Website, the App, or any of dineTab’s other products or services (the <strong>Services</strong>). By using the Services, You meaningfully consent to the Policy. In other words, You acknowledge that You have all the information You need to give clear, free, and informed consent and You give Us such meaningful consent to collect, use, or disclose Your personal information. As such, please read both of the Policy and Our Terms of Use very carefully. Again, if You have any questions, concerns, or complaints please do not hesitate to send Us a message.&nbsp;</p>

                <h4><strong>a. Modifications to the Policy</strong></h4>

                <p>We may make modification(s), change(s), or amendment(s) to the Policy from time to time. These modification(s), change(s), or amendment(s) become effective as soon as the updated Policy is published on the Website or the App. If the Policy changes in the future, We will post an updated version on the Website. Your continued use of the Services after any modification(s), change(s), or amendment(s) to the Policy have been made constitutes an acceptance of the modification(s), change(s), or amendment(s). As such, We recommend that You check the Policy periodically to see if it has been updated, and if so, to review it. If You do not agree to the updated Policy, either in whole or in part, then You may not use the Services. You can tell if the Policy has changed by checking the effective date that appears at the top of the Policy. Depending on the circumstances and subject to Our sole discretion, We may also decide to send You a notice electronically that the Policy was changed.&nbsp;</p>

                <h3>2. <strong>What We collect</strong></h3>

                <p>dineTab collects Your personal information whenever You use the Services. We only collect the personal information that is necessary to provide You with the Services. As such, We may collect the following information from You whenever You use the Services:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Name</li>
                    <li>Phone number</li>
                    <li>Email address</li>
                    <li>GPS location (if You grant Us permission)</li>
                    <li>Credit card number (which is not retained longer than is necessary to complete the transaction), and, if necessary, credit card billing address and mailing address (which is not retained longer than is necessary to complete the transaction)</li>
                    <li>Facial images (only if You upload a picture)</li>
                    <li>Transactions at the SMBs made with the App</li>
                    <li>Stripe account number (please see ‘Fee &amp; Payment’ section in the <a href="#terms">Terms of Use</a>)</li>
                    <li>Firebase &amp; Google analytics data, which includes information such as device models, operating systems, session duration, Your activities &amp; behaviour on the Services, and demographical information (please visit <a href="https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/6318039?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this website</a> for further information: )</li>
                </ul>

                <p>We may also get information about You from third parties, such as Google or Apple. This information can include Your:&nbsp;</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Name; and,</li>
                    <li>Email address</li>
                </ul>

                <p>As mentioned above, We only collect Your GPS location if You have permitted Us to do so. If You have previously consented to this but would now like to disable it, You can disable location gathering by going to the settings in Your device. For Android phones, this is normally found in the “App permission” section in the settings, and under the category “Location”. In iPhones, this is normally found in the “Privacy” section in the settings, and under “Location Services”.&nbsp; You will then see a list of applications that have access to Your location. Find the App in the list and turn off the App’s ability to have access to Your location</p>

                <h3>3. <strong>How We collect it</strong></h3>

                <p>We collect Your personal information through a variety of means. For instance, when You sign up for an account or contact Us, We collect the following information:</p>

                <ul>

                </ul>

                    <li>A record of the transaction&nbsp;</li>
                </ul>

                <p>When You are using the App, We automatically collect Firebase &amp; Google analytics data. If You choose to upload Your photo to Your account, We also collect Your facial image.&nbsp;</p>

                <h4>a. <strong>Our Use of Cookies and Log Files</strong></h4>

                <p>We currently do not use cookies or log files but may do so in the future. If We decide to use these technologies, We will notify You and make such a change to the Policy. We may notify You by either sending You an email (if You have an account registered with dineTab) or publishing a notice on the Website and the App that the Policy has been modified, changed, or amended. If We decide to use cookies or similar technologies, We will also provide You with information on how to disable them if it is possible to do so without significantly hindering Our ability to provide You with the Services.&nbsp;</p>

                <h3>4. <strong><em>What We use Your personal information for</em></strong></h3>

                <p>We use the personal information We collect about You in order to provide You with the Services. This includes:</p>

We use this financial information to facilitate Your transaction with the SMBs, such as processing and fulfilling Your payment to the SMBs and sending You messages that confirm the completion of Your payment.</p>

                <p>We will retain Your personal information only for a time and to the extent necessary for the purposes for which it was collected as described in the Policy and for reasonable backup, archival, audit, or other similar purposes. Please see the ‘Data Retention’ section of the Policy for further details</p>

                <h4>a. <strong>Do We use any automated decision-making processes?</strong></h4>

                <p>We currently do not use any automated decision-making processes to make predictions, recommendations, or decisions about You. However, some third parties that We work with might. For instance, Stripe, Our payment processor, possibly does. Please see <a href="https://stripe.com/en-ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stripe’s website</a> for more details. For more information about the policies of the third parties We work with, please visit their websites or contact them. If You would like a full list of the third parties We work with, please contact Us. However, You can find many of them listed in Section 5 below.</p>

                <p>If We decide to start making predictions, recommendations, or decisions about You using automated decision-making processes, We will inform You by either sending You an email (if You have an account registered with dineTab) or publishing a notice on the Website and the App that the Policy has been modified, changed, or amended. We will also provide You provide You with an opportunity to submit observations.&nbsp;</p>

                <h3>5. <strong>Who We share Your information with&nbsp;</strong></h3>

                <p>In accordance with the Policy, We may share Your personal information within dineTab or with Our service providers. We may also share this information with Our financial, insurance, legal, accounting, or other advisors that provide professional services to Us. We may also share information in a manner consistent with the Policy with third parties involved in providing the Services to You, including any authorized resellers, distributors, merchants of record or payment processors, subcontractors or entities participating in Our supply or repair chains, such as <a href="https://stripe.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stripe</a>, <a href="https://mailchimp.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mailchimp</a>, <a href="https://apple.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, <a href="https://segment.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Segment</a>, and <a href="https://google.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google</a> (like <a href="https://cloud.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google Cloud</a>, <a href="https://maps.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google Maps</a> if location gathering services is permitted, and <a href="https://firebase.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Firebase</a>). While We make best effort to ensure that these third parties provide standard, industry-wide, commercially reasonable security practices, any information that is supplied to them is not within Our control and are subject to these third parties’ own privacy policies and terms of use.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>We may also use third party APIs and software development kits (<strong>SDKs</strong>) to provide You with the Services. Some of the APIs and SDKs We currently use include Segment, Mailchimp, App Annie, Firebase, Flutter, and Google Tag Manager. APIs and SDKs may allow third parties to collect Your personal information and use it for a variety of purposes, including to provide You with customized content or to provide analytics services to other companies.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>We share Your personal information with the SMBs whose products and services You purchase. Beyond that, We do not share, sell, or rent Your personal information in personally identifiable form with any third party, except if, and to the extent necessary, in Our good faith judgment, doing so is required to:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>complete Your purchase;&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>comply with laws or regulations;&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>respond to a valid subpoena, order, or government request;&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>establish or exercise Our legal rights or defend against legal claims;&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>investigate, detect, supress, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or prohibited activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the reputation or physical safety of any person; or,</li>
                    <li>as otherwise required by law.&nbsp;</li>
                </ul>

                <p>We may anonymize Your personal information and maintain and use it in anonymous form that may later be combined with other information to generate aggregated, but still anonymous, information. Such anonymous and aggregated information may be sold, traded, rented, or shared.</p>

                <p>If dineTab is to be sold, merged, or amalgamated or substantially all of its assets are to be sold or disposed of, Your personal information may be transferred to a potential purchaser if, and to the extent necessary, it is required for the purposes of deciding whether to proceed with the proposed transaction and completing it. If such a sale, merger, acquisition, or disposal is completed, the purchaser may use and disclose Your personal information only to the extent described in the Policy if the information relates solely to the carrying on of the business or activity or the carrying out of the objects for which the sale, merger, or acquisition took place.</p>

                <h4>a. <strong>International Transfers</strong></h4>

                <p>We store some or all of Your data in the cloud using the Google Cloud platform (the <strong>Cloud Provider</strong>). As such, Your personal information may be collected, used, processed, transferred, and retained in multiple countries including Canada and the United States, and thus may be outside the region in which You are situated and may have different privacy or data protection legislation, and may therefore be subject to the laws of those countries.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>If You are a resident of a country which restricts data transfers outside of that jurisdiction or region without Your consent, by agreeing to the Policy and using the Services, You consent to Your personal information being transferred outside of Your country for processing or storage by or on behalf of Us and the Cloud Provider. If You reside in the European Economic Area (<strong>EEA</strong>), We may transfer Your personal information to Canada or the United States. If We transfer it to Canada, We use the European Commission Adequacy Decision as a safeguard. If We transfer it to the United States, We use the Model Clauses or self-certification under the Privacy Shield as safeguards.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Regardless of where You reside, if We transfer Your personal information outside of Your jurisdiction, We take steps to reasonably ensure that Your personal information is appropriately safeguarded and its use, collection, or disclosure is in accordance with the Policy.</p>

                <h3>6. <strong>Security&nbsp;</strong></h3>

                <p>We aim to provide You with a safe experience. We have in place certain physical, electronic, technological, and organizational safeguards to appropriately protect the security and privacy of Your personal information against loss, theft, unauthorized access, unauthorized disclosure, and unauthorized copying, use, or modification. For example, We use secure HTTPS certificates, SSL (Secure Socket Layers), Tokens, and other standard, industry-wide, commercially reasonable security practices.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Moreover, We use the following services provided by Google, which We have ensured provide standard, industry-wide, commercially reasonable security practices: Google Maps, Firebase &amp; Google Analytics, and Google Cloud. You may find more information about their security practices on their respective websites.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Please note, however, that while We try to make the Services secure and reliable for the Users, We cannot guarantee the security or confidentiality of any data or material, including Your personal information, transmitted to or from the Services or via email.

THE TERMS LIMIT YOUR ABILITY TO BRING FORTH OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND.

                <h3>What We Do</h3>

                <p>dineTab provides its users (the<strong> Users</strong>) the ability to pay their invoice through the App for products and services they purchase at businesses that partner with Us (the <strong>SMBs</strong>). <strong>dineTab is not a restaurant or a food preparation business or otherwise a retailer of any of the products and services the Users pay for through the App.</strong> We do not offer the SMBs’ products or services (the <strong>SMBs’ Products &amp; Services</strong>) themselves nor are We involved in the production of the SMBs’ Products &amp; Services offered by the SMBs. dineTab is a limited agent for these third party SMBs with the authority to collect payment from You on behalf of the SMBs for the purchase of the SMBs’ Products &amp; Services. We simply facilitate transactions and provide You with the ability to pay Your invoice at the SMBs directly through the App. In other words, We are not responsible for the SMBs’ Products &amp; Services themselves. We do not verify the SMBs compliance with any applicable laws or regulations and are not responsible for any defects in the SMBs’ Products &amp; Services, including in terms of their safety. This is the sole responsibility of the SMBs. Accordingly, the SMBs’ Products &amp; Services You purchase and consume constitutes a separate agreement between You and the SMBs to which dineTab is neither now, nor going forward, a party. Furthermore, all complaints regarding the SMBs’ Products &amp; Services should be directed to the SMBs. We do not assist in resolving these complaints nor do We have any obligation whatsoever to compensate You for any issues You encounter with the SMBs or the SMBs’ Products &amp; Services.&nbsp;</p>

You agree that You will provide accurate, complete, truthful and current information. You further agree that We may verify this information at any time.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>During the account creation process, We will require You to create and use a mechanism to uniquely verify Your identify. This verification may use a variety of forms, like alphanumeric password or a biometric characteristic (such as fingerprints) and may be combined with other identification methods such as two-factor authentication (collectively, the <strong>Identification Methods</strong>). You agree that You will keep Your account secure by restricting others from accessing Your account, including by restricting knowledge or use of the Identification Methods and otherwise keeping them secure and confidential. Moreover, You agree to promptly notify Us of any unauthorized access to Your account or of any security breaches. You also agree to accept all responsibility for all of Your account activities, including those activities that are the result of unauthorized access to Your account. In addition, You agree to provide Us with whatever proof We may reasonably need to verify Your identity.</p>

You and dineTab also agree not to join in on any claim, existing now or in the future, with the claims of another person (legal or natural) to participate in any class, representative, or collective proceeding of any kind.
